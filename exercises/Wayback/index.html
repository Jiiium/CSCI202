            This first screenshot is of Amazon from <b>Oct 13, 1999</b>. As you can see the site is completely different from what we are use to now-a-days. The site's focus appears to be on books, but the way to browse the site was via tab, rather than searching through a searchbar. This is probably due to the site not having a large inventory to search through.

            This screenshot is of Amazon from <b>Oct 04, 2006</b>. The site changes and has a searchbar to help with people searching for products. As you can see from the sidebar, Amazon expanded from just books and now has various products that they also sell.

            This screenshot is of Amazon from <b>April 09, 2016</b>. As you see the site undergoes a massive change and the searchbar is prominant. And the sidebar is hidden now, allowing the products to be on display, front and center.
