                <div class="hiddenBox" style="display:none">
                    <p>My hypertext self portrait has been a learning experience. I started out with an idea to make a webpage full of images I hand drew and align with invisible divs to click on or hover and bring up some revealing information about myself, but I ran into a bit of a snag and couldn’t figure out how to get the result I wanted. So I simplified the idea and just went with 3 images that are clickable and would zoom into the image to get a better look at the image. I however, mismanaged my time after class and ended up with little time to work on the site, so I deeply regret not being able to be more expressive and creative with my page. If I had all the time in the world, my vision for the page would be to create the original idea but with the inclusion of animations and images that I can move out of the way to reveal my personal facts and usage of the internet.</p>

                    <p>I was born in 1993, so growing up with the internet was probably different that my classmates. I vividly remember the old days of connecting to AOL for internet and using only 75kb/s to play old flash games on sites for kids like Neopets and Club Penguin. Each game on those sites with the speed provided played at pretty much, a couple of frames every second, making some items pop in really quickly or other items easier to find. It was quite the experience that I kind of wish I could experience again, but just for a day or two. I remember coming home each from school and turning on my parents computer to find new games to play on the cartoon network website, always striving to play all the games and come to my own decision on whether or not I liked the game. I guess I’ve always liked a site that has a colorful layout and design to welcome you to it and wanted to use those colorful imagery to be a reflection on my life and internet usage. Now-a-days, I think I’ve matured a bit more, using blander (in terms of colors) sites like Reddit and Facebook which probably explains the usage of the top and bottom black bars in my site design.</p>

                    <p>To me when I recall the reading about the technology and the advancement of ideology, I think this applies to my way of understanding webpages. Before I had only been a casual user of the internet where nothing really mattered to me as long as I could get to what I want and find what I’m looking for. However, now I’m interested in how a website is displayed and designed and to what function each element serves. This is still a new way of thinking to me, but my sense of ideology is changing day by day and soon these new ways of thinking will shape how I approach all my website designs, rather than just try to get the information all laid out on a page.</p>
